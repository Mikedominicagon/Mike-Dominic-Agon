    <h1>WHAT IS CHEATING?</h1>

    <p>
        
        <h3>    Cheating in school robs everyone involved. The cheater,</h3>
        <h3>their peers, and the teacher are all deprived of the </h3>
        <h3>full benefits of education. When a student is chasing </h3>
        <h3>higher grades or feeling overwhelmed by the school workload, </h3>
        <h3>the temptation to cheat will appear, and it's the job of </h3>
        <h3>the student to resist that temptation.</h3>
